# AsitLib (v2)

An ancient C# library used for a variety of different things. A core dependency of [STOLON](https://github.com/JTnadrooi/Stolon).

## Features

Most notable features are the `DebugStream` class and the large amount of extension methods.
Asit-filetype handling has been removed in v2, same goes for other miscellaneous uses like the name generator and SpellScipt\* support.

_\*Note: This was for the first iterations of SpellScipt - current `.spl` files wouldn't work and are now only supported by [Kaya.js](https://github.com/JTnadrooi/Kaya.js)._
